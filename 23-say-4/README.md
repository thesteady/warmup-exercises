# Say More

Write a program that will take a number from 0 to 999,999,999,999 and spell out that number in English.

In other words, if the input to the program is `12345` then the output should be `twelve thousand three hundred forty-five`.

The program must also report any values that are out of range.

Extra Credit:

Use _and_ (correctly) in the English number:

* fourteen
* one hundred
* one hundred and twenty
* one thousand and two
* one thousand three hundred and twenty-three
