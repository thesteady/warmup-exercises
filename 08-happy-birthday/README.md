# Happy Birthday

Write a program that asks what year a person was born in, then the month, then the day.

Figure out how old they are and give them a big SPANK! for each birthday they have had.

## Extensions

1. Calculate their age in seconds (approximately! We don't know what time they were born, and that's OK).

2. Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone is in standard Earth years.

3. Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:
   - Mercury (orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years)
   - Venus (orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years)
   - Mars (orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years)
   - Jupiter (orbital period 11.862615 Earth years)
   - Saturn (orbital period 29.447498 Earth years)
   - Uranus (orbital period 84.016846 Earth years)
   - Neptune (orbital period 164.79132 Earth years)

An Earth year is roughly 365.25 days, or 31557600 seconds.
